        id="DuplicatePlatformClasses"
        severity="Fatal"
        message="`commons-logging` defines classes that conflict with classes now provided by Android. Solutions include finding newer versions or alternative libraries that don&apos;t have the same problem (for example, for `httpclient` use `HttpUrlConnection` or `okhttp` instead), or repackaging the library using something like `jarjar`."

        summary="Duplicate Platform Classes"
        explanation="There are a number of libraries that duplicate not just functionality of the Android platform but using the exact same class names as the ones provided in Android -- for example the apache http classes. This can lead to unexpected crashes.&#xA;&#xA;To solve this, you need to either find a newer version of the library which no longer has this problem, or to repackage the library (and all of its dependencies) using something like the `jarjar` tool, or finally, rewriting the code to use different APIs (for example, for http code, consider using `HttpUrlConnection` or a library like `okhttp`).">

        id="ScopedStorage"
        severity="Warning"
        message="WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE no longer provides write access when targeting Android 11+, even when using `requestLegacyExternalStorage`"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="8"
        summary="Affected by scoped storage"
        explanation="Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using `requestLegacyExternalStorage`). In particular, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` will no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent of `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` instead.&#xA;&#xA;As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new storage permissions:&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`&#xA;&#xA;and then add `maxSdkVersion=&quot;33&quot;` to the older permission. See the developer guide for how to do this: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granular-media-permissions&#xA;&#xA;The `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can be used to manage all files, but it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.&#xA;&#xA;To learn more, read these resources: Play policy: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-help Allowable use cases: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-usecases"

        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html as well as follow this guide:&#xA;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html"

Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.&#xA;&#xA;If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.&#xA;&#xA;Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background.

        summary="Hardcoded text"
        explanation="Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several reasons:&#xA;&#xA;* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)&#xA;&#xA;* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources.&#xA;&#xA;There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup."

        explanation="To enable right-to-left support, when running on API 17 and higher, you must set the `android:supportsRtl` attribute in the manifest `&lt;application>` element.&#xA;&#xA;If you have started adding RTL attributes, but have not yet finished the migration, you can set the attribute to false to satisfy this lint check.">
